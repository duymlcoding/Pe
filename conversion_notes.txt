SPECIAL CONVERSIONS:
-------------------

1. TCOLORBOX ENVIRONMENTS:
   - conceptbox → {note} admonition
   - conceptbox[title=...] → {note} with custom title
   - formulabox → {important} admonition
   - formulabox[title=...] → {important} with custom title
   - examplebox{Title} → {prf:example} Title
   - stepbox → {dropdown} Solution Steps
   - keybox → {admonition} :class: tip

2. DISPLAY MATH FORMATTING:
   - All $$ blocks have blank lines before and after
   - Converted from LaTeX inline display: \[ ... \] → $$ ... $$
   - Converted from equation environment to $$
   - No equation numbering added (as per instructions)

3. LITERAL DOLLAR SIGNS:
   - All monetary amounts escaped: $ → \$
   - Examples: \$1,000, \$4, \$105, etc.
   - LaTeX math variables kept as-is: $x$, $\alpha$, etc.

4. SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
   - Subscripts: Preserved (e.g., CH₄, H₂O in running text)
   - Superscripts: Converted to unicode or kept in math mode
   - Degree symbol: Converted to °C

5. TABLES:
   All tables converted to Markdown table syntax:
   - Headers with | separator
   - Alignment row with |---|
   - No complex multirow/multicolumn structures were present

6. LISTS:
   - \begin{enumerate} → numbered lists (1., 2., 3.)
   - \begin{itemize} → bullet lists (-)
   - Custom labels preserved where important

7. REMOVED ELEMENTS:
   - \documentclass and preamble
   - \begin{document} and \end{document}
   - Page layout commands
   - Color definitions (handled by CSS in Jupyter Book)
   - Headers and footers
   - \newpage commands

8. YAML FRONTMATTER:
   Created from document title information:

CONTENT INTEGRITY:
-----------------
✓ 100% of original content preserved
✓ No new examples added
✓ No new explanations added
✓ All mathematical content intact
✓ All solution steps preserved
✓ All example problems preserved
✓ Original structure maintained

FORMATTING QUALITY CHECKS:
--------------------------
✓ All display math has blank lines before/after
✓ All literal dollar signs escaped
✓ LaTeX math not escaped
✓ No emojis added
✓ No bold around dollar signs
✓ Proper admonition syntax used
✓ No navigation links added
✓ Flat structure (no nested parts)

SPECIAL NOTES:
-------------
1. Part 2 and Part 3 had incomplete \end{document} tags (showed as "nd{document}")
   - This was noted but did not affect conversion

2. All three parts were seamlessly combined into one document
   - No duplicate content
   - Logical flow maintained
   - Part 1: Introduction to Material Balances
   - Part 2: Advanced Material Balances Examples
   - Part 3: Introduction to Energy Balances

3. All mathematical notation uses standard LaTeX commands
   - No custom macros needed in _config.yml
   - All will render correctly with standard MathJax

4. No complex elements requiring manual intervention:
   - No TikZ diagrams
   - No complex multi-page tables
   - No bibliography references
   - No \input or \include commands
